# Thumb clusters

The older Kinesis Advantage had the top row of thumb cluster keys in the following order, left to right:
Left hand: Command/Windows, Alt; Right hand: Control, Command/Windows
The Kinesis Advantage 360 shipped with this instead:
Left hand: Control, Alt; Right hand: Command/Windows, Ctrl

I have remapped it to use the older layout to which I'm accustomed and physically changed the keycaps to match.

## Tmux

I've mappped "command + m" to send "control + b" for Tmux.
